#On-the-Integration-of-Similarity-Measures-with-Machine-Learning-Models-to-Enhance-Text-Classificat
This work comes with three main contributions represented in: (1) proposing new models, and presenting benchmarking study for integration methodology on twelve big balanced/imbalanced datasets; (2) offering detailed analysis for dozen of integrated models which are basically established, and experimentally proven, to significantly conquer state-of-art performance. The models' construction used fourteen similarity measures, three knowledge representations (BoW, TFIDF and Graph), and five models (Support Vector Machine, N-Centroid-based classifier, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayesian, Convolutional Neural Network, and Artificial Neural Network); and (3) introducing significantly-effective and highly-efficient variations out of these five models. The evaluation study has been made internally for integrated models against their baselines, and externally against the state-of-art models. While internal evaluation statically showed total enhancement rate of 49.3% and 59% for integration methodology, external evaluation attested the superiority of our proposed original and integrated models.
